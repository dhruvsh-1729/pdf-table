He was conferred upon the title of Rai Bahadur in the   same year.

2) Prof. Chakravarti was well versed in the various schools of western philosophy. He brought his wide learning and deep scholarship to bear upon his study of Jaina philosophy. His introduction to the Pancastikaya(Arrah, 1920) is a valuable exposition of Jaina metaphysics and the path of moksa. In 1937 he delivered Principal Miller Lectures which published under the title ‘Humanism and Indian Thought’ He was a 
stalwart Jaina sravaka of his times in Tamil Nadu. He was specially interested in Jaina Tamil literature on which he had written a monograph in English ( Arrah, 1941). He  has edited a number of Tamil works by Jaina authors with their commentaries and, in some cases, with his learned exposition in English. For instance, Neelakesi, the text and the commentary of Samaya Divakara Muni, along with his elaborate Introduction  in English (Madras 1936); Tirukkural by thevar, along with the Tamil commentary by Kaviraja Pandithar (Bharatiya Jnanpith Tamil Series, No. 1 with an English Introduction) and Tirukkural, with English translation and commentary and an exhaustive Introduction (Madras, 1949). He has also edited the Meru-mandara-puranam In Tamil. His exposition (described by M.S.H. Thompson, in the J.R.A. Society, London, 1925 as ‘an indispensable aid to the study of tirukkuram’) of the Tirukkuram has been hailed both in India and outside as a learned and liberal exposition of the Kural, the Tamil Bible. His ‘Religaon of Ahimsa’ is published by Shri Ratanchand Hirachand, Bombay (1975) It is a learned exposition in English of some aspects of Jainism.  

3) Prof. Chakravarti, as an authority on his subject, contributed a number of essays And articles on Janisim, ahimsa and contemporary thought to various publication such As Cultural Heritage of India Philosophy of the East and West Jaina Gazette, Aryan path Tamil Academy. He wrote both in English and Tamil. Some of his papers are
Reprinted in the Yesterday and Today, Madras, 1946. He was a member of a number of Associations and Institutions in Madras.

4) As a pious Jaina and a deep scholar of  Jainism, he wrote a commentary in  English on the Samayasara of Kundakunda. He mainly follows the Sanskrit commentary of Amrtacandra. Still his exposition of the Samayasara and his evaluation of its contents clearly demonstrate how able he has expounded the principals of Kundakunda to make them intelligible to the modern world. This was published by the Bharatiya Jnanpith, and ascend edition of it is a lately issued.

5) Prof. Chakravarti was a well-wisher of the Jnanpith and he gave two of his work As noted above for publication in the Jnanpith Series. We are thankful to Thiru V. Jaya  Vijiyam, B.E. (33, Pudupet Garden street, Roypeeth Madras) for a bio-data of Prof. Chakravarti. He is the grandson of the late Professor from his daughter Smt. V.C. Jothimala. ",

•        Title: My Encounter With Jainism
•        Author: Mr. Leon Bensimon
•        Journal: Jinamanjari: International Journal of Contemporary Jaina Reflections
•        Issue: Vol. 29, No. 1 (April 2004)
•        ISSN: 1188-0287 (print)
•        Notes: This issue is edited by Bhuvanendra Kumar and published by the Bramhi Jain Society (U.S. & Canada); the article text is reproduced on Ahimsa Foundation’s site and multiple references identify the same issue metadata. 
Short bio (verifiable highlights)
•        Background & India ties: Léon Bensimon was a French pacifist/yoga teacher who went to the subcontinent in 1951 with the Service Civil International, lived in Indian ashrams, and was closely connected with Acharya Vinoba Bhave (Gandhi’s spiritual heir).
•        Paris years: Taught hatha-yoga in Paris for many years; acquaintances included figures like B.K.S. Iyengar and J. Krishnamurti (per contemporaneous recollections).
•        Publications: He also wrote reflective pieces on spiritual life, e.g., “Deux expériences intérieures en Inde” (3e Millénaire).
•        Later life: Sources recall him as Moroccan-born (Fès) and note a date of death in 1991 (memorial reflection). 

Early Paris Life & Teaching
•        By 1974, Bensimon had already been teaching yoga in Paris for many years.
•        He lived in a small attic on Rue de Vaugirard, near Luxembourg Gardens.
•        His room was very modest—just a bed, desk, and sink—radiating balance and tranquility.
•        On the walls were photographs with Pandit Nehru, the Dalai Lama, Vinoba Bhave, and one of himself in the yogic lion pose (tongue out, which he joked was to welcome visitors).
•        Practiced detachment and simplicity: valued inner life over possessions.

Views on Freedom & Yoga Teaching
•        Believed true freedom requires not identifying with anything—but admitted he hadn’t fully achieved this.
•        Had been teaching hatha yoga (learned in India) for more than a decade.
•        Chose students carefully, insisting they be sincere and persevering.
•        Emphasized presence, breathing, relaxation, and releasing tension (“as long as there is a tense fingertip, you cannot go further”).
•        Adapted intuitively for each student: “For each student, I feel what is needed.”

India Experience & Encounters
•        Went to India in 1951 with the International Civil Service (ICS), driven by pacifist ideals of nonviolence, cooperation, and service.
•        Lived in many ashrams, met Swami Sivananda (Rishikesh sage) and J. Krishnamurti.
•        With Krishnamurti, had a profound experience: his mind cleared of questions, felt merged with everything (“I was the cow, I was the water carrier, I was everything”).
•        Strongest influence: Vinoba Bhave, Gandhi’s spiritual heir and founder of the Bhoodan (land donation) movement.

Bond with Vinoba Bhave
•        Felt a mystical connection with Vinoba on April 18, 1951, in Grenoble—the same day Vinoba began his first land donation walk.
•        Lived with Vinoba at Sevagram Ashram, accompanied him on his pilgrimages across India.
•        Witnessed Vinoba’s immense efforts: walking thousands of kilometers, persuading landowners, and distributing 2 million hectares of land to peasants.
•        Vinoba encouraged villages to be self-sufficient and republic-like.
•        Bensimon admired Vinoba’s detachment, humility, energy, and practicality: “Vinoba himself does not act, he is ‘acted’.”

Daily Life with Vinoba
•        Routine: up at 3 AM, prayer, then walking with Vinoba from 4 AM onwards.
•        In villages, locals welcomed Vinoba with flower garlands and guards of honor.
•        Through these pilgrimages, Bensimon felt freedom, joy, and peace.

Return to Paris & Reflections
•        Eventually returned to Paris but saw himself as a citizen without borders; considered India his second homeland.
•        Felt urban Paris wasn’t conducive to contemplation, but he wanted to share what he learned.
•        Motivated students to visit India—saw their journeys as a continuation of his own.
•        Often said his greatest joy was in those mystical, harmonious moments “when the entire universe passes through you.”
